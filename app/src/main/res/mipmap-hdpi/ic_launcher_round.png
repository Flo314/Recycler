/**
 * Marks the annotated declaration as deprecated.
 *
 * A deprecated API element is not recommended to use, typically because it's being phased out or a better alternative exists.
 *
 * To help removing deprecated API gradually, the property [level] could be used.
 * Usually a gradual phase-out goes through the "warning", then "error", then "hidden" or "removed" stages:
 * - First and by default, [DeprecationLevel.WARNING] is used to notify API consumers, but not to break their compilation or runtime usages.
 * - Then, some time later the deprecation level is raised to [DeprecationLevel.ERROR], so that no new Kotlin code can be compiled
 *   using the deprecated API.
 * - Finally, the API is either removed entirely, or hidden ([DeprecationLevel.HIDDEN]) from code,
 * so its usages look like unresolved references, while the API remains in the compiled code
 * preserving binary compatibility with previously compiled code.
 *
 * @property message The message explaining the deprecation and recommending an alternative API to use.
 * @property replaceWith If present, specifies a code fragment which should be used as a replacement for
 *  the deprecated API usage.
 * @property level Specifies how the deprecated element usages are reported in code.
 *  See the [DeprecationLevel] enum for the possible values.

 *     For function calls, the replacement expression may contain argument names of the deprecated function,
 *     which will be substituted with actual parameters used in the call being updated. The imports used in the file
 *     containing the deprecated function or property are NOT accessible; if the replacement expression refers
